# TODO

* Monadic (State) version of search
    * Filter list beforehand
* Pattern matching including everything in [Quinapalus](http://www.quinapalus.com/cgi-bin/match)
* [Edit distance](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/edit-distance).
* Anagramming
* Add other useful lists (ex. chemical element symbols, countries, etc.)
    * (How to include proper nouns?)
* Convert numbers to letters and vice versa.
    * Segment numbers into messages.
* Searching allowing slight mistakes (ex. hamming/edit distance 1) or multiple words (tricky)
    * Difficult: searching over rule space.
* Each word has list of completions?
* Represent dictionary as Tries [trie](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-trie-0.2.4.1/docs/Data-Trie.html).
